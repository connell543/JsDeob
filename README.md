# JsDeob
  JSDeob is a Python-based command-line tool designed to deobfuscate JavaScript code, primarily for malware analysis. It processes JavaScript and HTML files, extracting and simplifying obfuscated code by decoding string arrays, atob calls, escaped sequences, and optionally running code in a Node.js sandbox.
